    "Because you run in the evening, breakfast and especially lunch are your fueling meals — don't skimp on daytime carbs. Keep the late-afternoon snack light and familiar so nothing sits heavy at 6 PM. Build meals around whole-grain carbs, lean protein for repair, colorful produce, and healthy fats in moderation. Limit alcohol and heavy/greasy food the day before a long run. Iron matters for endurance — include lean red meat, beans, and spinach, and pair plant iron with vitamin C.",
